# OS1 Memory Management Assignment

This repository contains the solution for the Memory Management assignment of the Operating Systems (OS1) course (CSC3002F: 2024) at the Department of Computer Science, University of Cape Town, South Africa.

## Assignment Overview

The assignment involves simulating memory management, particularly memory address mapping, in a virtual memory system. The simulated system supports up to 1KB of physical memory with 12-bit virtual addresses. The program, named OS1Assignment.java, takes an input sequence file containing a sequence of virtual memory accesses and translates each address into the corresponding physical address based on a given page table.

## Implementation

The solution is implemented in Java and consists of the following components:

- **OS1Assignment.java:** This is the main program file that reads the input sequence file, performs address translation using the provided page table, and generates the corresponding physical addresses. It utilizes methods for file reading, hexadecimal to binary conversion, page table lookup, and writing results to an output file.
- **Input Files:**

  - **OS1testsequence:** A simple test sequence file containing 8 memory accesses used for initial testing.
  - **OS1sequence:** The sequence file used for generating output for the assignment solution.
- **Output File:**

  - **output-OS1:** This file contains the list of hexadecimal strings representing the translated physical addresses generated by the program for the input sequence file.

## Usage

To run the program, provide the input sequence filename as a command-line parameter. For example:

```
java OS1Assignment OS1sequence
```

## Additional Notes

- The fixed page-to-frame mapping, as shown in the provided page table, is preloaded into an array for address translation.
- The program assumes only one process for simplicity.
- The solution includes error handling for file input/output operations and missing page table entries.
